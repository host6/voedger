## Key Findings

### Architecture Strengths ✅
- Modular design with reusable workflows
- Multiple trigger types (push, PR, schedule, manual)
- Storage-specific testing (CAS, Amazon, TTL)
- Auto-merge capability for small PRs
- Failure notifications via issue creation

### Critical Issues ⚠️
1. **Unsafe script fetching** - No version pinning
2. **Missing Go caching** - Slow builds
3. **No concurrency control** - High costs
4. **Missing timeouts** - Potential hangs
5. **Complex secrets** - Hard to manage

### Quick Wins 🎯
1. Add Go module caching (30-40% faster)
2. Pin script versions (security)
3. Add concurrency control (40% cheaper)
4. Set job timeouts (reliability)

- [ ] Set job timeouts
- [ ] Review and optimize secret usage

### Week 4: Monitoring
- [ ] Setup performance monitoring
- [ ] Create dashboards
- [ ] Establish alerting
